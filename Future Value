# Analysis:
# Make a program that will find out how much an investment will grow in value given the amount of years that pass
# Specifications:
# Take input from user of initial investment
# Take input for how many years have passed
# Take input for interest rate as decimal
# Input those values in an equation to output and print the future value of the inital investment
# Relation:
#principal(1+apr)^10
# Create Design:
# Get initial investment input from user
#  Get amount of years into the future input from user
# plug that info into equation PV * (1+r)^2 = Future value

def futurevalue():
    inital_investment, years, interest_rate = eval(input("Enter inital investment, years, and interest rate"))
    final_value = inital_investment*(1+interest_rate)**years

    print("The final value is = $", final_value)
futurevalue()
