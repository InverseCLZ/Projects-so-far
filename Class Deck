# Create a class Deck that represents a deck of cards and a class
# Card that represents a single specific suit and number. Your classes should have the
# following methods:
# • constructor: Creates a new Deck with a list of 52 objects of the class Card. Hint:
# you can use two FOR loops to iterate over suits and numbers.
# • shuffle: Randomizes the order of the cards in the list. You can use a built function
# from a library.
# • deal Card: Returns a single card (object) from the top of the deck and removes
# the card from the list.
# • cardsLeft: Returns the number of cards remaining in the deck.
