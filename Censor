# analysis:
# Write automated censor program that reads the text from a file nad creates a new file where all
# four-letter words get replaced by ****.
# assume no words in file are split across multiple lines.
# HINT: work in version that ignores punctuation and assumes file does not have change of line characters
# then work in following version building logic to deal with both challenges.

# Spec:
# get story from input file
# look for 4 letter words
# replace said words with ****
