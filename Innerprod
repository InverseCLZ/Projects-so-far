# Analysis:

# program should write and test function innerprod(x,y) that computes the inner product of two lists x & y
# ask user for how many elements both lists will have, read elements one by one using either for or while loop
# first the elements of the first list and hten the other list. Inner product of x and y is computed as:
# n-1
# sum  xi * yi
# i = 0
