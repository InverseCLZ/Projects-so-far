# write a program that reads student's final grades using a while loop.
# Then it should print the grades sorted from smallest to largest. No need to consider efficiency of program.
# start with the simplest solution even though it involves several steps or loops
# you cannot use the built in function: sort().
# Hint: use as many lists as needed
